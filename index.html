		<h2>Carnivore</h2>
		<p>
			A carnivore /ˈkɑːrnɪvɔːr/, meaning "meat eater" (Latin, caro, genitive carnis, meaning "meat" or "flesh"<br/> and vorare meaning "to devour"), is an animal whose food and energy requirements derive solely from animal tissue or meat, <br/>whether through hunting or scavenging.[1][2] Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores <br/>while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores.[2] <br/>Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and, apart from the more general definition, there <br/>is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore.[3] <br/>A carnivore at the top of the food chain, not preyed upon by other animals, is termed an apex predator.		</p>
